# URLShortner

This is a Python program that uses the Bitly API to shorten URLs. The program creates a GUI using the Tkinter library where users can enter a long URL, click a "Shorten" button to shorten the URL, and then copy the shortened URL to their clipboard using a "Copy" button. The program handles errors, such as if the URL cannot be shortened or if the API request fails.
